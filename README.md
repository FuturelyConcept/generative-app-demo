- **Loads policies at startup** from POLICIES directory
- **Reads/writes data** from DATA directory
- **Makes dynamic decisions** based on policies and data

## 🔧 Key Technologies

### Backend
- **FastAPI** - Single catch-all route
- **OpenAI API** - Real AI decision making
- **PyYAML** - Policy configuration
- **Python JSON** - Simple data storage

### Frontend  
- **Next.js 14** - App Router architecture
- **React 18** - Dynamic UI components
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Responsive styling

## 🎛️ Configuration

### AI Providers
The system supports multiple AI providers:

```bash
# OpenAI (Recommended)
AI_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Mock AI (Development)
AI_PROVIDER=mock

# HuggingFace (Free alternative)
AI_PROVIDER=huggingface  
HF_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Ollama (Local)
AI_PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434
```

### Business Rules (POLICIES Directory)
Modify any policy file in `POLICIES/` to change application behavior instantly:

#### Access Control (`POLICIES/access_control.yaml`)
```yaml
access_policies:
  admin:
    permissions: [view, add, delete, update]
    ui_elements: [product_table, add_button, delete_buttons, admin_panel]
```

#### Business Logic (`POLICIES/business_rules.yaml`)
```yaml
business_rules:
  product_management:
    stock_thresholds:
      low_stock: 20
      critical_stock: 5
```

#### UI Behavior (`POLICIES/ui_behavior.yaml`)
```yaml
ui_behavior:
  themes:
    admin: 
      color: "red"
      layout: "full"
      style: "powerful"
```

## 🧠 How AI Decision Making Works

### 1. Request Analysis
AI receives any HTTP request and analyzes:
- Request path and method
- User role from headers
- Request payload
- Current policies

### 2. Intent Recognition
AI determines what the user wants:
- `get_products` - List products with role-based filtering
- `add_product` - Create new product (if authorized)
- `delete_product` - Remove product (if authorized)
- `get_categories` - Category analytics (if feature enabled)
- `get_menu_items` - Dynamic menu generation based on policies
- `get_user_context` - Fetch user capabilities
- `unknown` - Handle unrecognized requests gracefully

### 3. Permission Validation
AI checks loaded policies to determine if user can perform the action based on:
- Role-based access control
- Feature availability (e.g., categories feature)
- UI component visibility rules

### 4. Dynamic Response Generation
AI generates appropriate response with:
- Role-specific data filtering
- Contextual insights and recommendations
- UI adaptation instructions
- Real-time analytics
- Dynamic menu items based on available features

## 🎮 Interactive Demo Features

### 1. Role Switching
Use the left sidebar to switch between `admin`, `manager`, and `viewer` roles. Watch the entire application adapt instantly.

### 2. Product Management
- **Admin**: Can view, add, delete products + see analytics
- **Manager**: Can view, add products + see business insights
- **Viewer**: Can only view products

### 3. API Explorer
Use the "API Tester" tab to experiment with any endpoint. Features include:
- **Editable URL paths** - Change endpoints dynamically (e.g., `/api/products/p1` to `/api/products/p2`)
- **Editable request bodies** - Modify JSON payloads for POST/PUT requests
- **Method selection** - Switch between GET, POST, DELETE, etc.
- **AI handles unknown requests** intelligently

### 4. Live Policy Changes
Edit any file in `POLICIES/` directory and see application behavior change without restarting.

### 5. Dynamic Menu Generation
Watch how menu items appear/disappear based on loaded policies:
- **Basic demo**: `./start-full-demo.sh` - Only "Products" and "API Tester" appear
- **Extended demo**: `./start-full-demo.sh EXTENDED_POLICY` - "Categories" menu item appears for admin/manager
- **Truly dynamic**: Menu items generated based on policy availability

### 6. Add Complete New Features 
Use the start script argument to demonstrate adding entire new API endpoints and functionality:
- **Basic**: `./start-full-demo.sh` - Core functionality only
- **Extended**: `./start-full-demo.sh EXTENDED_POLICY` - Categories feature automatically added
- **Zero manual copying**: Script handles policy copying automatically

## 🔒 Security & Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- ✅ All `.env*` files are in `.gitignore`
- ✅ API keys never committed to repository
- ✅ Use `.env.local` for local development

### API Security
- 🔒 Role-based access control via headers
- 🔒 AI validates all permissions
- 🔒 Input validation through AI analysis
- 🔒 CORS properly configured

## 🚧 Development

### Manual Setup (Alternative to start script)

#### Backend Only
```bash
./start-backend.sh
```

#### Frontend Only
```bash
./start-frontend.sh
```
