# POLICIES Directory

This directory contains all the business logic and behavioral rules for the AI Runtime Engine. The AI makes ALL decisions based on these policies - no hardcoded business logic exists anywhere in the code.

## 📋 Policy Files

### 🔐 `access_control.yaml`
- **Purpose**: Role-based permissions and access control
- **Controls**: Who can do what, UI element visibility, role hierarchy
- **AI Uses This For**: Permission validation, UI adaptation, security enforcement

### 🏢 `business_rules.yaml`
- **Purpose**: Core business logic and validation rules
- **Controls**: Product rules, pricing, inventory thresholds, data validation
- **AI Uses This For**: Data validation, business logic enforcement, rule compliance

### 🎨 `ui_behavior.yaml`
- **Purpose**: Frontend behavior and theming
- **Controls**: UI themes, form behavior, table columns, user experience
- **AI Uses This For**: Dynamic UI generation, role-based theming, interface adaptation

### 📊 `entities.yaml`
- **Purpose**: Data structure definitions
- **Controls**: Entity fields, operations, validation schemas
- **AI Uses This For**: Data structure understanding, operation validation, schema enforcement

### 💬 `ai_responses.yaml`
- **Purpose**: AI response templates and prompts
- **Controls**: Success/error messages, AI decision prompts, response formatting
- **AI Uses This For**: Consistent messaging, decision guidance, response generation

### ⚙️ `system_config.yaml`
- **Purpose**: Technical system configuration
- **Controls**: Performance settings, security config, demo settings
- **AI Uses This For**: Runtime behavior, system limits, operational parameters

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **AI Loads All Policies** at startup
2. **Every Request** is analyzed against these policies
3. **Dynamic Decisions** are made based on policy rules
4. **Real-time Changes** take effect when policies are modified
5. **Zero Code Deployment** - just update policy files

## ✏️ Making Changes

### Instant Updates
Most policy changes take effect immediately:
- Access control modifications
- UI behavior changes
- Business rule updates
- Message template changes

### Restart Required
Only system configuration changes require restart:
- AI provider changes
- Performance settings
- Security configurations

## 🎯 Key Benefits

- **Zero-Code Business Logic**: All rules in YAML files
- **Independent Management**: Each aspect managed separately
- **Version Control Friendly**: Small, focused files
- **AI-Driven Execution**: Policies guide AI decisions
- **Instant Policy Updates**: Change behavior without code deployment

## 🔍 Policy Validation

The AI Runtime Engine automatically validates:
- ✅ Policy file syntax
- ✅ Cross-reference consistency  
- ✅ Rule completeness
- ✅ Security implications
- ✅ Business logic coherence

## 📝 Best Practices

1. **Keep policies focused** - One concern per file
2. **Use descriptive names** - Make intent clear
3. **Document changes** - Add comments for complex rules
4. **Test changes** - Verify policy updates in demo
5. **Version control** - Track policy evolution

**Remember**: These policies ARE the application logic. The AI engine simply executes what you define here!
